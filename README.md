# EMI
Operation of the light rig shall not reduce up- or downlink ranges by more than 5%. The rig should preferably be compliant with relevant EMI standards.

# Minimum performance standard
The FAA issues Technical Standard Orders ([TSO]) which sets a *minimum performance standard* for aviation design approvals. EASA publishes the European Technical Standard Order ([ETSO]) which is similar. Both sets of orders identifies the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) AS8037 and AS8017 as the minimum performance standard for *Aircraft Position Lights* and *Anticollision Light Systems*

* Standards set forth in the Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc., (SAE) Aerospace Standard (AS) Document AS 8037 „Minimum Performance Standard for Aircraft Position Lights“ dated January 1986.
* Standards set forth in the Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc., (SAE) Aerospace Standard (AS) 8017A „Minimum Performance Standard for Anticollision Light Systems“, dated January 30, 1986.


* The navigation lights shall have at least 10 candela intensity.
* The emission pattern shall be compliant with XXXX

# Color
The color of the lights should be as defined in [Fed Std. No. 3][FS3]
* Aviation red
* Aviation green
* Aviation white
